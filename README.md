# PyramidBuilder
Make an pyramid app only by using HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript. This automatically creates code and configures the file.

As wrote above, anyone can easily develop an app using HTML, CSS and Javascript knowledge. You can use CSS, and Javascript if you want, else neglect them, pure html can also be used to develop an pyramid app, or more precisely a webapp.

- #### And make sure you have python installed on your device.

# Steps to create an App :-
Simply, prepare HTML files using inline CSS and <script> tag for Javascript on the same HTML file. Multiple files can be used but individual CSS and Javascript for them should be in the same file in which you have HTML.

- #### You have to download the PyramidBuilder.py file from this repository. Though repository may be a big word, simply download the file from the main branch.(above ðŸ‘†)
- #### Then,  the only think you to do is to double-click on it and further the program is self explanatory. It's a GUI based program, so you  don't have to worry about learning to code.

# Configuration that You Need to Do :-
Due to some reasons, such as time unavailability, some configuration you also need to do.
Although in some future update, this feature will be automatic (Hoping Soon!).
Till then, manual configuration has to be done.
  
In HTML files, **Images should be in Base64 format**(textual),  
For example, if you have an image link, i.e. `<img src='Folder/SubFolder/abc.png' width=300 height=550>` then it should be changed as, `<img src='data:image/png';base64, code'>`, you can get it converted through many websites such as  CodeBeautify on `https://codebeautify.org/image-to-base64-converter`.
There you can get the Base64 code, complete `<img>` tag with everything done is also provided.
Now handling large Base64 Code can be done using Notepad. Since its smoother while handling such large code.

Now, links,
Linking should be done in the following way :-
