# PyramidBuilder
Make an pyramid app only by using HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript. This automatically creates code and configures the file.

As wrote above, anyone can easily develop an app using HTML, CSS and Javascript knowledge. You can use CSS, and Javascript if you want, else neglect them, pure html can also be used to develop an pyramid app, or more precisely a webapp.

# Steps to create an App :-
Simply, prepare HTML files using inline CSS and Javascript files on the same page. Multiple files can be used but individual CSS and Javascript for them is the same file in which you have HTML.
